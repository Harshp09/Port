        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Jabalpur Engineering College, located in
          Jabalpur, in 2012.
          Following that, I pursued and successfully completed my Master's degree in Electrical Drives from Maulana Azad
          National
          Institute of Technology (M.A.N.I.T) in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, in 2016.
          <br><br>
          Since 2017, I have been serving as an <b>Assistant Professor</b> within the Department of Electrical
          Engineering at Delhi
          Technological University, under the Government of N.C.T Delhi. In this role, I have had the privilege of
          contributing to
          the academic and intellectual growth of students while furthering my own research endeavors.
          <br><br>
          Presently, I am deeply engrossed in my Ph.D. journey within the Department of Electrical Engineering at the
          esteemed
          Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, situated in New Delhi, India. My doctoral research is centered around
          the realms
          of power electronics, electrical machines, and drives. I am committed to advancing knowledge and innovation in
          these
          areas, aiming to make meaningful contributions to the field.
          <br><br>
          Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have continually sought opportunities to expand my
          understanding and
          expertise in electrical engineering, driven by a passion for learning and a desire to make a positive impact
          in my
          field.
